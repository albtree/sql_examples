# SQL & PowerBI Examples
Examples of SQL code & PowerBI dashboarding using fictional healthcare data from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/prasad22/healthcare-dataset). Randomisation of values was undertaken to help create a unique dataset. The list of hospitals was reduced to four to better represent a Melbourne Metropolitan Health Network whilst still allowing for some variation.

A SQLite database was created using the following [csv files](example_healthcare_data) in which the [linked queries](health_care_kaggle_queries.sql) were written to clean, and explore the data.

The same data was then exported to PowerBI. Below is an example of a PowerBI Dashboard I created using aforementioned data. Filters are present through the use of slicers on each page of some common questions stakeholders may be interested in.
